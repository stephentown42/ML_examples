It may therefore be useful to resample data specifically from the most relevant data - i.e. if we have a missing age value for a male passenger, we resample from the available ages for only men. This organization of the dataset is sometimes called *stratification* and can be particularly useful in cases like gender, where there are a small number of possible categories\n",
