# Machine Learning Examples

Templates for building machine learning models

Many problems that can be addressed using machine learning use common design patterns. This library contains some basic examples to show a working knowledge of different approaches, and provide templates for use and modification with other problems

## Goals of this repo


The goal of this repo is to showcase the investigative process involved in data science and go beyond short demos to highlight how in deep analysis can reveal structure and insight. Examples are shown in Python, but the goal is to extend the repo to include other languages such as R, to illustrate that it is the critical thinking that is central to data analysis and modelling, rather than particular tools. We also aim to expand the story-telling beyond scripting languages to commonly used dashboards such as Tableau to emphasize the importance of story telling in connecting users with data.

The titanic dataset is often used to illustrate principles to people as they begin their journey in machine learning and data science. But rather than just presenting an introduction to these topics (for which many publications already exist) this book seeks to answer the question, what would it look like if someone with 15 years experience analysed this dataset? How well could they understand this data and make predictions about held-out records. At a more personal level, this book is also a measure of how much my 15 years of experience in research science has been worth? 

On that topic, I should say that I come from a particular background focussed on biomedical research, where we prioritise interpretable models that allow us to make inferences on data rather than predict results in typical machine learning problems. My focus through my career has therefore been on more on the side of statistical modelling 

### Data science as detective work

### Finding the narrative

Data science means nothing if you can't communicate your findings to others, particularly colleagues, clients and stakeholders who might have little understanding of the specific methods used to discover insights. 

### An Data-set driven approach

Often in data science courses, we go through lots of different datasets that are selected to showcase a particular method. Here we take a different approach and use the same dataset in every example. There are several reasons for this choice: firstly, most workflows are defined by the dataset in use - a data scientist at a company may be presented with tables of sales data and asked to solve a particular problem. It's unlikely someone will ask you to find company data and apply a particular method (e.g. K-means clustering) to it, unless that method has already been selected for it's appropriateness, or the company in question is actively developing that method.

I also hope that by focussing on a single dataset, we can build familiarity with the data in a way that makes examples more intuitive as we go through the book, and allows us to draw direct comparisons between methods.
