# Neural Decoding with XGBoost

The code here illustrates how to use activity of individual neurons to recover information about stimuli presented to subjects. The goal here is to provide a demo for functions in use as part of a larger project (not yet published). The best way to start is to check out the notebook:

* [Jupyter notebook](./xgboost_demo.ipynb)
* [Python script](./xgboost_demo.py)
* [module for data preprocessing](./xgboost_preproc.py) 

Unfortunately the source data for this analysis hasn't been released but we're hoping to get it out soon.
