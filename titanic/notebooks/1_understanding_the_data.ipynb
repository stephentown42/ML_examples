    "As always, the first step in any data analysis pipeline is to understand what you're looking at. The strategy one uses to look at the data can depend on where you're coming from. If you're a domain expert, you may already have some intutitions about what to expect; even the average person will have some expectations about the behavior of different measurements. We should be aware that these expectations will shape how we interpret any data we receive, but also remember that such expectations are built on years of experience that can help us understand what we're looking at in more detail.\n",

    "The top plot above confirms our theory that children younger then 5 tended to be more likely to survive.

Below we'll use the <b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov test</b> to compare the empirical distribution function of the test data with the cumulative distribution function of a reference distribution - in this case, a normal distribution. The test returns a statistic that tends to zero when the observed distribution matches the reference, or increases towards 1 (not sure if this is the upper bound though) as the distributions differ. One can also use a p-value to decided how likely the two distributions are to match.\n",

We could try log-transforming the data, but there are several passengers that paid £0 for their tickets (and for which we would get an error transforming). These were generally employees of ship lines that will be discussed in Chapter 2 and marking these data as missing (or at least not applicable) might make sense for several reasons. Here, we'll apply a log-transform after removing zero fares:"

For example, we can't include tickets from the test data in our calculation of group size, even though it's likely that some tickets have passengers in each dataset. Why can't we merge test and train data to calculate group size for tickets? Doing so would mean that data from the test set could influence any model that we subsequently fitted and thus give us an unfair advantage. This might be tempting when we have only one test dataset, but in general it's bad practice as it would harm our ability to generalize in the long term.\n",

This seems more permissible because we are not fitting any model to the test data, we're just making predictions. Consider for example a case where the test dataset consisted of only a single passenger. In this situation, we wouldn't be able to calculate group size from the test dataset alone. However we could use our past knowledge of the training set to extend what we know about the test passenger. (The problem with this approach is that it treats each passenger in the test dataset independently, and it's possible that multiple test passengers share the same ticket. Our current appraoch ignores this at present.)\n",

For example, we might wonder if there is some link between people with common surnames that goes beyond family relationship. In the context of the titanic dataset, such influences are probably weak because the variation in names is relatively small compared to the level of social mixing in the 1910s. However if we looked more carefully, we might be able to gain insight into aspects such as nationality with names with different spelling ('Braun' vs 'Brown'). We'll pick up on this in Chapter 3 and the concept of word-embeddings.\n",

Other intuitive relationships we can see include that tickets with more people on cost more (r = 0.53) and the larger the family size, the lower the average age (r = -0.3).

It might also be possible to combine social relationships with other variables such as age to build features such as the likelihood of being a parent or child.

    "We don't intend to use passenger Id in our model, but it's useful to just double check that there's no obvious relationship between this key and survival. It's possible in some datasets that the initial data collection is not random, for example if everyone who survived was listed first and thus had higher passenger IDs than those that died. If we only care about predictive performance, then we could exploit such a relationship. There isn't anything obvious in this particular dataset, but you'd be surprised how often primary keys contain information.\n",

    "## 1.3. Interactions between features\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:14px;line-height:1.5\">\n",
    "Within our dataset, we have a number of features that might be correlated, or interact in interesting ways. For example, we might expect children to pay less for tickets than adults, or that the effect of gender on survival is limited to adults. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Identifying interactions of interest of important for deciding which statistical and machine learning approaches to use. For example, you may see people attempt to predict survival in the test data using a <b>Naive Bayes Classifier</b>, however this approach assumes that each feature of the data is <i>independent</i>. If this assumption isn't true and we find that there are relationships between features (spoiler alert, we will), then we're using the wrong tool for the job, because (i) the classifier can't take advantage of the information that exists within those relationships, and (ii) the classifier is working on the basis of invalid assumptions. (Note that this isn't to say Naive Bayes is generally a bad method, it does well under many circumstances, but this chapter is about establishing expectations based on the data and so we don't expect the Naive Bayes classifier will end up being the solution).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Understanding how features interact is also valuable for specifying the design of statistical models, or where we fit full models (models that consider all features and all interactions between features, with appropriate regularization), for assessing the outcome of the fitting procedure. It also helps us think about the kind of higher dimensional spaces that models can explore to fit the data - for example, to find a latent space for affluence that is comines information about class, fare, deck and relatedness to someone with a professional title.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.3.1. Gender & Age\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:14px;line-height:1.5\">\n",
    "When considering the effects of gender, we might expect such an influence to be more pronounced in older individuals and not in young children. This is what we see in the data, where the difference in survival of men and women grows with age. This suggests that a model that includes both Sex and Age should out-perform a model based on Sex alone (see Chapter 5).\n",

    "<p><b>Identifying missing data (going beyond NaNs)</b></p><p>\n",
    "In this chapter, we took our first look through the dataset. Initial inspection of the data highlighted that several columns (e.g. Age and Cabin) contain missing data. Most often missing data was encoded as NaNs, but we also found some examples where missing data was a part of a string (e.g. prefixes on ticket numbers) or required us to thing further about the meaning of the data itself (in the case of passengers paying zero Fare). We saw how the absence of this data can itself be informative about survival, if the data are not missing at random, and we created features with the specific intention of encoding whether data was present or absent. In chapter 2, we will explore these issues further and see how we can estimate the values of these missing data using different methods. \n",
    "</p><p>\n",
    "<b>Distributions</b></p><p>\n",
    "Visualizing the distribution of continuous variables in the data such as Fare showed that such features are not normally distributed and may require transformation. When it was not clear if a variable such as Age was normally distributed, we used a statistical test (the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) to provide an objective decision. The absence of normal distributions is not surprising, given we know that most continuous variables in the dataset cannot take on negative values.\n",

    "<b>Intuitive relationships</b></p><p>\n",
    "Within the data, we saw relationships that match our expectations about survival of passengers on a sinking ship in terms of age, class and gender. This gives us confidence that there is information within the features that will allow us to predict survival on the test dataset. Though we might expect to be confident in the case of this specific dataset, it's always important to consider whether data make sense and that there is actually some information to extract.\n",

    "<b>Marking progress</b></p><p>\n",
    "Finally, we began to extract more of this information from variables such as Name and Ticket Number, and build features such as the profession of passengers, the number of people they were travelling with etc. We could capture the functions used to extract these variables in a python module or sklearn pipeline; however in order to maintain the notebook format we'll keep these functions here for now and save our progress as new csv tables with extra features. \n",

    "<p>In the next chapter, we will take feature engineering further to consider some of the advanced tools for thinking about the problem of predicting survival. Although Chapters 2 and 3 address Imputation and Feature Engineering separately, it is not necessary that one step proceed the other. Some might argue that imputation is a form of feature engineering and there are certainly synergies between the two processes; engineering features can improve the quality of imputation, while imputation can open up new opportunities for feature engineering. \n",

    "The pipeline for our analysis therefore looks like the diagram below, with multiple pathways and the potential for iterative refinement of the data through multiple steps. If we're fortunate enough to have a full dataset (i.e. no missing data) and we're specifically interested in the primary data, we can go straight to Chapter 4 and the prepration of data for machine learning. This chapter will conclude the first part of the book before we look at the potential options for predicting survival in Part II.\n",
