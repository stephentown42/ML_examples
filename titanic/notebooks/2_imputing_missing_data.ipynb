Either we ignore Age and Cabin, or we develop a strategy to deal with missing values.

    "In complete case analysis, we drop any rows or columns that contain missing data. This method is simple and easy to implement, but has several problems:   \n",
    "<br>(1) Dropping cases is inefficient as we reduce the number of data points we can use for model fitting, and we lose statistical power with the reduced sample size.\n",
    "<br>(2) Dropping missing data may bias the results if the missing data is not missing completely at random. (Consider the case where age data is missing specifically from passengers that perished)\n",
    "<br>(3) Dropping cases with missing data doesn't provide a useful strategy for making predictions on new test data that contains missing values. If we just delete missing data, then either we can't base predictions a feature that contains missing data (which is highly undesirable) or we have to skip test cases where data is missing (which will hurt performance badly).\n",

    "</p><p>\n",
    "In the titanic dataset, we have so many cases of missing cabin data that to limit ourselves to a complete case analysis would reduces the size of our training set dramatically. We also have good reason to believe that features like Age and Deck (a transform from Cabin) are associated with survival (see Chapter 1) and so we definitely want to include them in the model. For the reasons above, we will avoid removing missing data. \n",

Sometimes  data acqusition systems will return values out of range or zeros. Numeric coding can be a major issue when those responsible for the data collection use zeros or other values, as it distorts the distribution of data while simultaneously masking missing data. It's therefore always worth looking out impossible numbers or inflated counts at specific numbers.  \n",

    "<b>Disadvantages of the regression method</b>\n",
    "</p><p>\n",
    "Although regression approaches are more sophisticated than basic mean or median imputation, it is important to say that regression predictions are still draws from the center of a distribution. This means that we will always predict the same age for a fixed set of predictors (e.g. a third class passenger whose name begins 'Master' and has 4 siblings), when in reality, we know that passengers with the same metadata may vary somewhat. This sampling approach that does not account for this uncertainty will thus continue to systematically underestimate variability. \n",
    "</p><p>\n",
    "As Little and Rubin (2020) state \"single imputation cannot reflect sampling variability under one model for missingness or uncertainty about the correct model for missingness\". This prevents us from assessing how sensitive subsequent analysis is to different theories about why data is missing. \n",

    "Hot deck imputation is a method for handling missing data in which each missing value is replaced with an observed response from a “similar” unit (<a href=\"http:\\\\www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3130338\">Andrige & Little, 2011</a>). Hot deck methods thus tend to draw from the same dataset (e.g. other passengers on the titanic), which can be contrasted with 'cold-deck' procedures in which samples are drawn from other data sources (e.g. passengers on other ships, or past sailings - if the titanic hadn't been on it's maiden voyage).\n",
    "</p><p>\n",
    "Here we will primarily consider what are sometimes called <i>random hot deck methods</i>, as they involve randomly selecting a donor value from a set of potential donors. This can be contrasted with <i>deterministic</i> hot deck methods that involve identification of a single donor.\n",
    "</p><p>\n",
    "<b>Advantages</b>\n",
    "</p><p>\n",
    "\"Unlike mean imputation, the distribution of the sampled values of Y is not distorted by the imputations.\" (Little and Rubin, 2019). Sampling <i>with</i> replacement leads to additional sample variance, which can be reduced by sampling <i>without</i> replacement. \n",
    "</p><p>\n",
    "Another advantage is that, unlike regression, you don't need to worry about model specification and draws from the available data will always been in a sensible range (i.e. no negative ages).\n",

    "We might have good reason to believe that a variable with missing data is dependent on other features in the data. For example if female passengers tended to be older than male passengers. It may therefore be useful to resample data specifically from the most relevant data - i.e. if we have a missing age value for a male passenger, we resample from the available ages for only men. This organization of the dataset is sometimes called <i>stratification</i> and the groups of data created by stratifying are sometimes called <i>adjustment cells</i>.\n",

If you don't know which features to use, you may want to map correlations as we did ahead of regression in Section 2.3.3. Alternatively, one might build a decision tree for large datasets to identify the important features.\n",
    "</p><p>\n",

    "\n",
    "When imputing missing data, one might think that we should combine data from the training and test datasets, so that we can maximise our ability to estimate missing values. However, if we were to merge the two datasets, we would potentially risk **data leakage** that might undermine the model we're training. \n",

In such situations, one must instead model the process that causes missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Recoverability is a data-independent task that takes as input a pair, a query and a model, and determines if the value of the query can be estimated as sample size approaches infinity, assuming that only variables assigned R variables can be corrupted by missingness.\" (see Mohan & Pearl 2021 for discussion).\n",

    "There is much discussion about the conflicting demands between methods in statistics and machine learning (REFERENCE). Imputation is one example where this comes into play, as the goal of the kaggle competition - and machine learning approaches more broadly, is to find the best predictions of the missing values for the survival column.\n",

    "However statisticians are more often interested in making inferences about population quantities such as means, correlations and regression coefficients. In such cases, \"the objective of imputation is not to get the best possible predictions of the missing values, but to replace them by plausible values in order to exploit the information in the recorded variables in the incomplete cases for inference about population parameters\" (Little & Rubin, 2002)\n",

Using imputation, we could fill in that missing data to predict passenger's ratings for those possible trips and then select those trips that are likely to be well rated. This is a **recommendation system** like those used in a variety of services (Netflix, Spotify etc.) and is based on the solution to an imputation problem of filling in missing data."
