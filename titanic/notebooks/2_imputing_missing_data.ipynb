Either we ignore Age and Cabin, or we develop a strategy to deal with missing values.

    "In complete case analysis, we drop any rows or columns that contain missing data. This method is simple and easy to implement, but has several problems:   \n",
    "<br>(1) Dropping cases is inefficient as we reduce the number of data points we can use for model fitting, and we lose statistical power with the reduced sample size.\n",
    "<br>(2) Dropping missing data may bias the results if the missing data is not missing completely at random. (Consider the case where age data is missing specifically from passengers that perished)\n",
    "<br>(3) Dropping cases with missing data doesn't provide a useful strategy for making predictions on new test data that contains missing values. If we just delete missing data, then either we can't base predictions a feature that contains missing data (which is highly undesirable) or we have to skip test cases where data is missing (which will hurt performance badly).\n",

    "In the titanic dataset, we have so many cases of missing cabin data that to limit ourselves to a complete case analysis would reduces the size of our training set dramatically. We also have good reason to believe that features like Age and Deck (a transform from Cabin) are associated with survival (see Chapter 1) and so we definitely want to include them in the model. For the reasons above, we will avoid removing missing data. \n",

Sometimes  data acqusition systems will return values out of range or zeros. Numeric coding can be a major issue when those responsible for the data collection use zeros or other values, as it distorts the distribution of data while simultaneously masking missing data. It's therefore always worth looking out impossible numbers or inflated counts at specific numbers.  \n",

    "Although regression approaches are more sophisticated than basic mean or median imputation, it is important to say that regression predictions are still draws from the center of a distribution. These draws will thus continue to systematically underestimate variability. \n",
    "</p><p>\n",
    "As Little and Rubin (2020) state \"single imputation cannot reflect sampling variability under one model for missingness or uncertainty about the correct model for missingness\". This prevents us from assessing how sensitive subsequent analysis is to different theories about why data is missing. \n",

The limitation of this approach is that each individual estimate is uncertain, although we can use multiple imputation to assess how much of an impact this uncertainty has on our model performance.

It may therefore be useful to resample data specifically from the most relevant data - i.e. if we have a missing age value for a male passenger, we resample from the available ages for only men.

Using imputation, we could fill in that missing data to predict passenger's ratings for those possible trips and then select those trips that are likely to be well rated. This is a **recommendation system** like those used in a variety of services (Netflix, Spotify etc.) and is based on the solution to an imputation problem of filling in missing data."
