    "Some of the approaches we will cover in this chapter may not be well-suited to the titanic dataset. However, that's a feature rather than a bug in our book design. We specifically on a single dataset is intentional because it allows us to discuss not only the tools that are relevant to a particular problem, but also those tools that are not suitable. This approach mirrors the workflow one might normally encounter in the real-world, where your problem is centered around a dataset that you need to work with, rather than a technique you need to apply.\n",

    "[Chris Deotte](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/titanic-using-name-only-0-81818/notebook) makes the case that, if we assume that surname can be used as a proxy for family group (i.e. that there are no two unrelated individuals with the same surname), we can estimate the family survival rate for women and children. This then provides a strong predictor of survival for fellow women and children within the same social group.\n"
